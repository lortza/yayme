Microposting app for tracking, TILs, merit, praise, and gratitude.

Live on heroku as [yayme](http://yay-me.herokuapp.com)

## Features

* create different types of posts (ex: praise, TIL)
* renders posts in markdown
* takes codeblocks in markdown
* create markdown templates for types of posts

## Getting Started

* Fork & Clone
* `bundle`
* Set up DB: `rake db:setup` (Runs `db:create`, `db:schema:load` and `db:seed`)
* User: In development, see the seeds file for the user credentials so you can log in
* `routes.rb`: comment out line 7, uncomment line 10 to allow users to sign up at http://localhost:3000/users/sign_up

## Required Technologies
* You will also need a Dropbox account and a dedicated folder in your account for images. At the moment, the image url for posts is highly unsophisticated and is expecting a Dropbox url. If you want to use something other than non-smart url field (like being able to upload photos), go for it! :) You'll have a some work to do in this area.

## Tests
* Tests: `bundle exec rspec`

### Linters
This project uses these linters in CI:
* [reek](https://github.com/troessner/reek)
* [scss-lint](https://github.com/sds/scss-lint) | 
* [standard rb](https://github.com/standardrb/standard) (in support of the [VS Code extension](https://github.com/standardrb/vscode-standard-ruby?tab=readme-ov-file)). If VS Code is being a jerk about not recognizing the right version of ruby, you can set the ruby version via the VS Code terminal like: `RBENV_VERSION='3.3.6'`
* FactoryBot.lint -- coming soon

Run them locally on your machine like this:
```
bundle exec reek

bundle exec standardrb

bundle exec scss-lint app/assets/stylesheets/**.scss
```
